# What this does

Don't you hate it when text is hard-wrapped and you want to try to convert it so that it's soft wrapped? This LaunchBar action does exactly that. 

# How to install

Put everything into a folder called `Convert hard wrap to soft wrap.lbaction` to create the bundle. Double-click the bundle to install it or move it to your `~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions` folder.
